## Members

The voting members of the Magma Core Foundation TSC are listed [here](https://github.com/magma/Governance/wiki/Magma-TSC-Members)

## Policies and procedures

The Magma Core Foundation TSC is governed by the Technical Charter. The Charter provides a foundational structure for the TSC on topics such as its scope, how to make decisions, and how to make changes to itself. At the same time, it grants the TSC a high degree of freedom when determining how to implement the policies of the Magma Core Foundation.

The following policies and procedures have been adopted by the TSC.

### Making decisions

A majority of the eligible voting members participating at a meeting, or participating in an email vote separate from a meeting, shall constitute a quorum. A majority of the eligible voting members participating when a quorum is present shall be required to approve other actions of the Committee.

### Merging PRs into the TSC repository

Pull requests that do not change the charter or governance of the TSC can be merged into this repository provided the following conditions have been met:

*There are no outstanding objections
*There are two approvals by TSC members
*The PR has been open for at least 72 hours
*Pull requests that change governance of the TSC (excluding the charter) must be open for at least 14 days, unless consensus is reached in a meeting with quorum of voting members.

Pull requests that change the charter of the TSC must meet any requirements in the charter.

If consensus cannot be reached, a pull request may still be landed after a vote by the Voting members to override outstanding objections.

### Fast-Tracking PRs

Special exception is made for pull requests seeking to make any of the following changes to this repository:

Errata fixes.
Editorial changes.
Meeting minutes.
Updates to team lists.
Doc fixes.
Charter changes cannot be fast-tracked.

To propose fast-tracking a pull request, apply the fast-track label. Then add a comment that TSC members may upvote. If someone disagrees with the fast-tracking request, remove the label. Do not fast-track the pull request in that case.

The pull request may be fast-tracked if two TSC members approve the fast-tracking request. To land, the pull request itself still needs two TSC member approvals.

TSC members may request fast-tracking of pull requests they did not author. In that case only, the request itself is also one fast-track approval. Upvote the comment anyway to avoid any doubt.

### IP Policy

The [Magma Foundation IP policy](https://github.com/magma/tsc/blob/master/CHARTER.md#7-intellectual-property-policy) is defined in the [charter](CHARTER.md), and it applies unless an exception is explicitly approved by the TSC.
